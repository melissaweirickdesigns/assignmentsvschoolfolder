<!-- 1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?

to access react components. Without it, our js file will not recognize react and wont work properly

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?

javascript object

3. What's wrong with this code:
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```

You need to add a div as  you can only have one component in a variable for react components
